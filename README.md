# Hello-World
Hi My name is Brian and I'm interested in learning as much as I can about coding.
I find coding fascinating in terms of creation and also in terms of the idea of using commands to solve problems.
I have created formulas in Excel for most of my life and I'd like to take it a step further and create applications to solve my problems
I am interested in XCode & Swift primarily for making iOS apps right now.
But I also am very interested in learning SQL for managing data as I have in the past.
I am interested in Javascript, HTML & CSS for creating a website that has interactive tools.
I am interested in learning whatever else I can and growing my knowledge base to create what I want to.
I don't know which languages I will specialize in, but Swift is looking pretty good.
